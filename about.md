This blog is mainly about science.  I love science.  I have a PhD in
Optics from the University of Rochester and an MBA from the University
of San Francisco.  I have worked as an industrial physicist and
engineering manager in R&D and new product development of optical
components and systems.  I enjoy open source scientific computing and
learning all sorts of maker technologies and plan to talk about those
here as well.  I will also periodically mix it up with other non-tech
stuff I enjoy (like my English bulldog Hank).  I can be reached at
jdcorless at gmail dot com.
